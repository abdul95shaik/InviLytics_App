# InviLytics — Inventory Analytics Dashboard (Q, r Model)

**InviLytics** is an interactive inventory optimization app built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Altair**, designed to visualize key inventory control models such as **EOQ (Economic Order Quantity)** and **Reorder Point (r)**.

The tool allows users to explore how changes in demand, cost, and service level affect total inventory cost and stockout risk in real-time — bridging theory and analytics through intuitive visualization.

## 🧩 Features

- Dynamic EOQ visualization (U-shaped total cost curve)
- Real-time reorder point updates based on demand variability
- Interactive sliders for lead time, service level, and cost inputs
- Live KPI tiles for total cost, reorder quantity, and stockout probability
- Streamlit-based UI with dark, professional design

## 🧠 Key Learning

This app demonstrates how AI-assisted coding (via ChatGPT) and open-source libraries like **Streamlit**, **Altair**, **NumPy**, and **SciPy** can be combined to quickly build data-driven decision tools used in supply chain and operations management.
